# Red Beard and Crew: CS361 ChronoTimer 1009

Semester project for CS361 at UWM in Spring 2017.

**Members:** Evan Becker, James Hendley, Kim Pham, Evan Weatherly

Commits past 5/12/17 will be done by Kim Pham as an extension of the semester project into finishing details left out of the submission. There were various issues with the Sprint 4 submission and I did not have time to address them all by the due date by myself.
